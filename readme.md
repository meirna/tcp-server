# tcp-server

This repository is part of [Advanced Programming Techniques Final Project 2022](https://github.com/meirna/advanced-programming-project). It's a TCP server built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

This application implements the following features from the assignment specification:

 - Use TCP client-server communication for transferring basic data types and streams. (This project is the server, [here is the client](https://github.com/meirna/electron-forge-react))
 - Use symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
 - Use digital signatures and signature verification.
 - Use a 3rd party static library.
